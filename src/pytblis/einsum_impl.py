def einsum(*operands, out=None, optimize=True, complex_real_contractions=True, **kwargs):
    """
    einsum(subscripts, *operands, out=None, order='K',
           optimize='greedy')
    Evaluates the Einstein summation convention on the operands.

    Drop-in replacement for numpy.einsum, using TBLIS for tensor contractions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subscripts : str
        Specifies the subscripts for summation as comma separated list of
        subscript labels. An implicit (classical Einstein summation)
        calculation is performed unless the explicit indicator '->' is
        included as well as subscript labels of the precise output form.
    operands : list of array_like
        These are the arrays for the operation.
    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the calculation is done into this array.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the memory layout of the output. 'C' means it should
        be C contiguous. 'F' means it should be Fortran contiguous,
        'A' means it should be 'F' if the inputs are all 'F', 'C' otherwise.
        'K' is ignored, for now.
        Default is 'C'.
    optimize : {bool, list, tuple, 'greedy', 'optimal'}, default True
        Controls the optimization strategy used to compute the contraction.
        If a tuple is provided, the second argument is assumed to be
        the maximum intermediate size created.
        Also accepts an explicit contraction list from the ``np.einsum_path``
        function. See ``np.einsum_path`` for more details.
    complex_real_contractions : bool, default True
        If True, handle contractions between complex and real tensors by performing
        separate contractions for the real and imaginary parts of the complex tensor.
        This avoids NumPy type promotion if the complex and real tensors
        have the same precision (e.g., complex128 and float64).

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The calculation based on the Einstein summation convention.
